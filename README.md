# primitive-maybe

`primitive-maybe` allows users to create an Array of `maybe`
and a SmallArray of `maybe`

Array of `maybe` functions:
 - MaybeArray
 - MutableMaybeArray
 - indexMaybeArray
 - newMaybeArray
 - readMaybeArray
 - writeMaybeArray
 - sequenceMaybeArray
 - unsafeFreezeMaybeArray
 - thawMaybeArray
 - maybeArrayFromList
 - maybeArrayFromListN
 - sizeofMaybeArray
 
 SmallArray of `maybe` functions:
 - SmallMaybeArray
 - SmallMutableMaybeArray
 - indexSmallMaybeArray
 - newSmallMaybeArray
 - readSmallMaybeArray
 - writeSmallMaybeArray
 - sequenceSmallMaybeArray
 - unsafeFreezeSmallMaybeArray
 - thawSmallMaybeArray
 - smallMaybeArrayFromList
 - smallMaybeArrayFromListN
 - sizeofSmallMaybeArray
