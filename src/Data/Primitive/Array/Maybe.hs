-- | This provides an interface to working with boxed arrays
-- with elements of type @Maybe a@. That is:
--
-- > MaybeArray a â‰… Array (Maybe a)
--
-- However, this type provided by this module is more efficient
-- than its naive @Array@ counterpart. It consumes less
-- memory and has fewer heap indirections.
